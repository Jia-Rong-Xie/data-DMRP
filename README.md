# data-DMRP

The project provides the Python 2.7 scripts to simulate the data-driven model, to theoretically solve the data-driven model and to estimate the retweet probability of information items in Weibo. Two scripts load the network structure from the database table “fan_table”. Therefore, the database management system (MySQL for example) and MySQL_ database server for Python should be installed, and the database should be built before running the scripts “estimating_beat.py” and “simulating_dataDriven_percolation.py”.

The file “theoretically_solving.py” provides the code to theoretically solve the data-driven percolation model. The file “estimating_beta.py” provides the code to estimate the retweet probability of information items. The file “simulating_dataDriven_percolation.py” provides the code to simulate the data-driven model.
